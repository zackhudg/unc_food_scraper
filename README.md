# unc_food_scraper

This project is my attempt at learning the basis of the Django web server framework while also creating something that will be useful for me. 

My original vision was a sort of "Dining Tinder", where I would swipe left or right on the food choices that were served at the dining locaitons on UNC campus, and based off that I would get "matched" with the best X meals, where X is the number of swipes in my meal plan.
However, I decided to deviate a little bit to start and figure out the functionality and learn about the website-building process before implementing the fun and hopefully developing a mobile app to play on the Tinder idea more.
